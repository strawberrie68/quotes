# üìö Want to Remember everything you read?

Sometimes we highlight something in a book. We found it life-changing and we highlight it. But the thing is, 
even though we found it life-changing we still manage to forget it. In this project, I created an anki like app that 
helps you remember everything that you have read

## üë©‚Äçüíª How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

FrontEnd - Used React to help create the UI components

BackEnd - Used Mongoose Atlas for the backend database


## üè∏ Optimizations

Things I would like to fix/add
- Create an email function -> send you a list of quotes for you to see on your email, instead of reviewing the quote here
- Ability to import the quotes from your Kindle
- Could be used to study your notes
- Still need to perfect Anki function


## üìù Lessons Learned:

This project taught me a few important lessons. Learning about how a language works and the importance of documentation is very important when creating a project. It was my first time using React and I learned that in order for the app to be less buggy I have to build according to the document or else it won't work as I wanted. 

This was shown when I just wanted to toggle the Heart Component. Although the code was correct ( I believe) the Heart still wasn't toggle right. It was not until I understood that becasue of the order of my functions, React was rerendering even when it was not ready to be re-rendered
